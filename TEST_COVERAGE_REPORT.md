## Running Tests

### Quick Start
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Watch mode for development
npm run test:watch

# UI mode (visual test runner)
npm run test:ui

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### CI/CD Integration
Tests are configured to run with Vitest and can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines:
```yaml
- name: Run tests
  run: npm test
```

## Known Issues
